            I am a junior at Colorado School of Mines, and I am a total nerd for
            computer science. I have a passion for building things and solving
            problems, and I am very fortunate to be studying in a feild where I
            can make a difference while doing something that I love.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I like playing piano, going hiking, and playing
            pickup volleyball. I also love competitive coding, and I recently
            competed in the ICPC 2024 North America Championship!

          <p>The classic game of Minesweeper, written in C++ using SFML.</p>
          <p>
            Throughout this project I have learned a lot about C++, OOP
            principles, and developing a game from scratch. This is an ongoing
            project, and I am currently working on an algorithm that can solve
            boards on its own.

            This was a team project, and I made the backend. I created a Python
            Flask API that interfaced with Docker that could get hardware and
            user info, as well as create, stop and start containers. It also
            supported Docker swarm mode, and came with installation scripts. I
            learned many technical skills like APIs, networking, and scripting,
            but it was also very valuable to learn about documentation and
            collaborating with a team.

            An interactive map of the Mines campus to help guests and new
            students navigate inside buildings. This map can show an interior
            view of each building, along with information about each room like
            room number, upcoming events, and a street-view style 360° glimpse
            inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The map is a 3D model made in Blender with open street map data, and
            it is rendered using three.js. The website is made with Solid.js and
            Tailwind CSS.

            blast, and this is definitely a project that we want to build into a
            full app in the future!

            This is my first experience with frontend development. I have been
            learning about html, css, javascript, and everything related to the
            frontend. I created this website using Svelte, and the background is
            made with p5js.

            There are some things like I would like to add, like maybe hosting
            some of my projects here, but I am proud of what I have made!
